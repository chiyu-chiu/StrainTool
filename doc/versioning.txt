Two version identifiers are crucial within the Project:
    * StrainTensor.py, and
    * pystrain

The version of StrainTensor.py, is declared as a variable within the script
and can be obtained via the '-v' or '--version' switch.
The version variable's name is 'Version' and it is declared (defined) just after
the various import statements, at the top part of the source code. E.g.
``Version = 'StrainTensor.py Version: 1.0-beta (pre-release)'``

The version of pystrain library, is declared/defined within the pystrain/__init__.py
file. This file, is read during the installation process and the library's
version is set.
To obtain the version of pystrain, you can do something like:
```
import pystrain
print('{}'.format(pystrain.__version__))
```

Warning:
Versioning is crucial for the Project, as its development phase is still very
active. Whenever major changes are made, the versioning identifier(s) should
be accordingly updated.
